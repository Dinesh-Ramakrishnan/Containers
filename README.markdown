==========

This is a library containing C implementations of binary trees.

So far we have the following implementations:

- bstree  - a binary search tree
- dstree  - a digital search tree
- trie    - a Fredkin tree
- critbit - a crit-bit tree

Not yet implemented:

- patricia - a PATRICIA trie

See 'Algorithms' by Sedgewick for details of the algorithms.

Two additional libraries are provided for comparison with the tree data
structures:

- linkedlist   - a linked list in which elements are kept sorted
- orderedarray - an ordered array (again, sorted)
