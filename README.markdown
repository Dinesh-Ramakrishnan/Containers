==========

This is a library containing C implementations of binary trees.

So far we have:

- bstree - a binary search tree
- dstree - a digital search tree
- trie   - a Fredkin tree

Not yet implemented:

- critbit  - a crit-bit tree
- patricia - a PATRICIA trie

See 'Algorithms' by Sedgewick for details of the algorithms.

Two additional libraries are provided for comparison with the tree data
structures:

- linkedlist   - a linked list in which elements are kept sorted
- orderedarray - an ordered array (again, sorted)
